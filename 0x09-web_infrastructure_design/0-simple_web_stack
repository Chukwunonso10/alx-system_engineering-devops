ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

1. SPOF (single point of failure ) Since we are only using one server ,any issue with the server results to complete downtime of the website

2.DOWN TIME DURING MAINTENANCE
When we need to run some maintenace check on any component like updating server configuration ,the website may need to be restarted

3.LIMITED SCALABILITY
Since this infrastructure uses one server ,it may not be able to handle a high incoming traffic. The server will run out off resources and slow down upon highe traffic.
